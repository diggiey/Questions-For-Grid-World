1. No the bug doesn't always move to a new location, because sometimes it is turning when it runs into a wall.
2. The bug starts by moving north and then trun as it turns into things.
3. If the bug doesn't move, it turns 45 degrees to the right.
4. A bug leaves behind a flower when it moves.
5. When the bug hits the edge of the grid it turns until it is able to move again.
6. When there is a rock in the bugs way, the bug will turn until it is able to move around it.
7. No the flowers do not move, but they do change color.
8. A flower is placed down after a bug moves, and then it slowly changes it's color to black.
9. The rock does not move, and doesn't have any other behavior.
10. Yes a bug can be on top of a flower, but nothing else can be in the same location.

1. 	0 = North
	45 = North East
	90 = East
	135 = South East
	180 = South
	225 = South West
	270 = West
	315 = North West
	360 = North

2. You can move the bug anywhere that is on the map. By moving it outside the map, it createds an error and displays a window.
3. I used the setColor method to change the color of the actors.
4. The bug disapears and is removed from the grid.
